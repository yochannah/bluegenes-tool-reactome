    The reactome library doesn't offer modular compilation so we can't bundle
    it in. Thus, we have to work with its global methods.
    Here we're creating a handler for an event that is automatically fired
    but may or may not be fired by the time we load this script.
    The workaround is that we have a tiny global handler in globals.js that will
    run before we load reactome's firework script. It listens for reactome's
    automatically fired onFireworksReady() event and sets a global bluegenes
    config tool to true. We check if it's true recursively and give up after 5
    tries. To sum up:
    1. Globals.js listens for Reactome's fireworks script to be ready and
       sets `_toolAPIGlobals.fireworksReady = true`
    2. checkIfReactomeReady() checks for the var to be set to true and
       eventually gives up if nothing comes back...
    3. Other bits to note: We load this tool on pathways and on genes,
       but the queries are slightly different. Heavily annotated below.
